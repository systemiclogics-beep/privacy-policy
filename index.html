<h1>Privacy Policy for TinyABC123</h1>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> SystemicLogic</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to TinyABC123, a kids learning application developed by SystemicLogic.
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the app.
</p>
<p>
    TinyABC123 is designed for children, and we take privacy very seriously.
    The app does not collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    TinyABC123 does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users.
</p>

<p>However, the app uses Google AdMob to display non-personalized banner ads.</p>

<p><strong>AdMob may automatically collect:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Advertising ID</li>
    <li>Approximate location (non-precise)</li>
    <li>App engagement data (non-personalized)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This data is collected by Google, not by SystemicLogic.
    All ads shown to children are non-personalized, following Google Play’s Families Policy.
</p>

<p>For more details, visit Google’s Ad Policy:<br>

</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>
    Since TinyABC123 does not collect personal data, we do not use or store any user information.
</p>
<p>
    AdMob uses limited, non-personalized data to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Serve safe banner ads</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud</li>
    <li>Measure ad effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
    TinyABC123 is designed for young children.
    We comply with Google Play Families Policy Requirements and COPPA.
    We do not knowingly collect children’s personal information.
    All ads are set to non-personalized mode.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    The app uses only one third-party service:
</p>
<p><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – used to display a small banner ad at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
    Since TinyABC123 does not collect or store personal information, no user data is stored on our servers.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    Updates will be posted on this page with the new effective date.
</p>
